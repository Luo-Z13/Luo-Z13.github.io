# SkySenseGPT: A Fine-Grained Instruction Tuning Dataset and Model for Remote Sensing Vision-Language Understanding

## Introduction

In this project, we propose FIT-RS (Remote Sensing Fine-Grained Instruction Tuning), which is a large-scale fine-grained instruction tuning dataset contains 1,800,851 high-quality instruction samples. FIT-RS aims at enhancing the fine-grained comprehension ability of Remote Sensing Large Multi-Modal Models, i.e., the ability to understanding relationships among objects in complex remote sensing scenes.
