# SkySenseGPT: A Fine-Grained Instruction Tuning Dataset and Model for Remote Sensing Vision-Language Understanding

## Introduction

In this project, we propose the FIT-RS (Remote Sensing Fine-Grained Instruction Tuning) dataset, which contains 1,800,851 high-quality instruction samples covering various vision-language comprehension tasks. FIT-RS aims to enhance the fine-grained comprehension ability of Remote Sensing Large Multi-Modal Models (RSLMMs), specifically their ability to understand semantic relationships among objects in complex remote sensing scenes.
